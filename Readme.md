Kleekapp
==================================

Kleekapp was a Facebook application that enabled a user to create an event for friends. The application pulled data about nearby venues from Yelp and displayed them on a map. After choosing a venue the user would create the event and invite friends. Finally the event would have a map and custom flyer to make it more fun and attractive.

I retired the application due to the upcoming changes to Facebook's API, which would no longer enable event creation by API.
